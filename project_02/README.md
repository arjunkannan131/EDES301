## Project Overview

This project implements a custom Printed Circuit Board (PCB) for a digital "Etch-a-Sketch" device using a PocketBeagle microcontroller. The design includes user input through potentiometers and buttons, output via an SPI display, and RGB LEDs to enhance interactivity. The board is designed in Eagle, following all required design rules and constraints.
